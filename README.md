# CS5330 Content-based Image Retrieval

CS5330 Pattern Recognition & Computer Vision

NEU 2023 Fall

Instructor: Bruce Maxwell

Student: Shi Zhang

## Project Report

### 1. Project Description

The goal of this project is, given a database of images and a target image, find images in thedata with similar content.

### 2. Project Illustrations

#### Task 1: Baseline Matching

#### Task 2: Histogram Matching

#### Task 3: Multi-histogram Matching

#### Task 4: Texture and Color

#### Task 5: Custom Design

### 3. Extensions and Example Images

The two extensions I proceed with are: 
- Function to compute features from the co-occurrence matrix.
- Function to compute histograms of Laws filter responses.
- Function to compute histograms of Gabor filter responses.
- Function to compute the histogram of gradient orientations using Canny edge detector

### 4. Reflection
Throughout the course of this project, I delved deep into the nuances of image feature extraction and matching. I learned about the importance of selecting the right features for different tasks and how different algorithms can provide varying results. The project also reinforced the significance of preprocessing and normalization, especially when working with diverse image datasets.

### 5. Acknowledgments

I would like to acknowledge Professor Bruce Maxwell for the help in code review and troubleshooting during the office hour.
